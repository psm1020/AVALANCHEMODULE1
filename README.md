# Contract

This code serves as a straightforward example to illustrate the usage of the require, assert, and revert statements in Solidity.


## Description

This Solidity contract provides three functions (multiply, divide, and add) to perform basic arithmetic operations while demonstrating error handling techniques using require(), assert(), and revert() statements.


## Requirements

To use this contract, you will need a Solidity development environment, such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. You will also need a test network or a local blockchain to deploy and test the contract.
## Usage

To use this contract, follow these steps:

1)Open the Solidity development environment of your choice and create a new file.

2)Copy and paste the contents of Contract.sol into your file.

3)Compile the contract to check for any errors or warnings.

4)Deploy the contract to a test network or a local blockchain.

5)Call the setValue function with a uint256 value as an argument.

6)Check that the value variable has been set correctly by reading its value.
